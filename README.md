# PHP and PDO Examples
The repository contains basic PDO CRUD examples.

If you want to run the examples you will need to:-

1. Import the sql file, students.sql, into your database (look for the import tab).
2. Changing the connection settings in the PHP code so the examples work with your database.
3. Put the files on a web server.
